# devlinks // Link Sharing App

[**devlinks.fun**](https://www.devlinks.fun) is a web app developed as a solution to my first guru-level challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/linksharing-app-Fbt7yweGsT).

The app allows users to create personalized profiles where they can share their social links and professional information in the form of a profile card.

Users can easily manage their profile details, including adding a profile picture, updating their name and bio, and linking to up to 15 different platforms.

The project is currently live and accessible at [devlinks.fun](https://www.devlinks.fun), where users can experience the app's features and share their profile via a unique URL.
